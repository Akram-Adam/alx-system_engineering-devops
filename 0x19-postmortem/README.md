Issue Summary
Duration: 1 hour and 35 minutes, starting at 09:15 AM and ending at 10:50 AM UTC on August 16, 2024.

Impact: Picture this: 65% of our users—yes, the ones who pay our bills—were left staring at their screens, waiting for our static content to load. Some might have even thought about going outside for a change. It was that bad. The issue hit our EU users the hardest, with slow or completely unresponsive web pages.

Root Cause: One tiny misplaced line in our Nginx configuration file. Yes, you heard that right—a single typo caused all this chaos.

Timeline (AKA: The Series of Unfortunate Events)
09:15 AM UTC: Datadog decided to give us a wake-up call with an alert about a sudden drop in HTTP responses. No, it wasn’t because we were too popular.
09:18 AM UTC: Our on-call engineer, after spilling coffee in the rush, dove into the logs like Sherlock Holmes, hoping to find the culprit.
09:25 AM UTC: Initial thought: Is it traffic? Are we finally famous? Nope. Nginx was restarted, but the problem stuck around like a bad pop song.
09:35 AM UTC: Firewall and network configurations were scrutinized as if they had committed a crime. Still, no leads.
09:45 AM UTC: Senior DevOps team called in. (You know it’s serious when they show up.)
10:10 AM UTC: A sharp-eyed senior engineer noticed Nginx wasn’t listening—literally. A misconfigured binding directive was making Nginx ignore port 80 like it was an ex.
10:25 AM UTC: Configuration was fixed. We were hopeful. But, as the saying goes, If at first, you don’t succeed, reboot.
10:40 AM UTC: Deeper dive into the configuration, discovering the real issue—an invalid IP binding.
10:50 AM UTC: Finally, after correcting the Nginx config, service was restored, and the world (or at least our EU users) was happy again.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: Our downfall was a single line in the nginx.conf file. Instead of letting Nginx listen on all IPv4 addresses, we accidentally told it to listen to just one—a non-existent one. Nginx, like a moody teenager, decided if it couldn’t have that, it wouldn’t listen to anything at all.

Resolution: We put Nginx in therapy, a.k.a. fixed the listen directive. The command listen 80; was reinstated to make sure Nginx was paying attention to all its IPv4 friends. After a quick restart, everything was back to normal—users could refresh without fear.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:

Double-check all configurations. (Yes, even that one tiny line.)
Enhance monitoring to catch these kinds of slip-ups before they turn into a full-blown drama.
Share this story as a cautionary tale—complete with memes—in our next team meeting.
Tasks:

Patch Nginx Configuration: Audit and update all Nginx configurations across our servers. No more rogue IPs!
Enhance Monitoring: Implement checks that specifically look for active listeners on essential ports, so Nginx can’t sneak off again.
Update Documentation: Add a “What Not to Do” section in our Nginx documentation, complete with screenshots and emojis.
Team Training: Host a fun, interactive training session (with pizza) to teach everyone about the perils of configuration errors.
CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement: Add an automated validation step for configuration files—let’s have robots catch the typos for us!
And there you have it—a gripping tale of how a single line of code tried to take down the world, and how we heroically saved the day. Remember, next time someone says, “It’s just one line,” you’ll know better.
